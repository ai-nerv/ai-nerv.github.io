      <h2 id="rules">What holds it together</h2>
      <ul class="plain">
        <li><b>No shared code, in either direction.</b> balthasar's Rust never parses magi's types
        and melchior does not know what a harness is. What crosses is data each side parses into
        its own shapes — so any one of them can be replaced by something that speaks the same
        words. That is written down as a contract: see <a href="guides/roles.html">swapping a
        program</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Every sibling but the memory layer is optional.</b> Without casper a session has
        three builtin tools; without melchior it has no model and no other agents, and runs and
        says so. Without a memory layer it does not start: that layer is the store, and a session
        that cannot record is refused rather than run on a copy that goes stale.</li>
        <li><b>Linux only, and that is a decision.</b> Peer identity comes from
        <code>SO_PEERCRED</code>, which means there is no handshake token to design, issue or
        leak.</li>
        <li><b>One shape, two encodings.</b> JSON for anything a person might read; CBOR for a
        caller that is only going to parse it. Nothing is negotiated — a body says which it is in
        its first byte.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="why">Why separate processes</h2>
      <p>Three things fall out of the split that do not fall out of modules in one binary.</p>
      <ul class="plain">
        <li><b>A crash is contained.</b> A tool that segfaults takes down one process that was
        going to exit anyway. The turn sees a failed result, not a dead harness.</li>
        <li><b>The kernel does the identifying.</b> <code>SO_PEERCRED</code> names the program on
        the other end of a socket, so there is no token to issue and none to leak.</li>
        <li><b>The boundary is checkable.</b> A gate on the merge path refuses any file in a
        sibling that names a harness — the separation is enforced, not merely intended.</li>
      </ul>
${note("<b>A second implementation is what keeps a protocol honest.</b> magi ships a second tool peer written in Lua, deliberately unlike the first — a different language, a different lifecycle, and one thing it cannot do at all. A protocol with one implementation is a function call with extra steps.")}

      <p>The framing is the same on both: a big-endian <code>u32</code> byte count, then that many
      bytes. Self-delimiting, so a peer that dies mid-frame is caught at the length rather than
      misparsed deeper in.</p>

      <h2 id="shapes">Two shapes</h2>
      <p>A <b>call</b> expects an answer. An <b>event</b> does not, and nothing ever replies to
      one. The difference is whether anybody is waiting.</p>

CBOR's is a map or an array, whose first byte is <code>0x80</code>–<code>0xBF</code>. The ranges do not overlap, so reading the encoding off the body is a reading rather than a guess — and a peer that has never heard of CBOR is unaffected.")}

      <p>A refused verb is <code>{\"ok\":false,…}</code> with <b>exit status zero</b>. A real error
      arriving as “exited 1” is indistinguishable from the binary being missing, and the two

      <p>A session that waited for somebody else to have launched a memory layer would record
      sometimes and not others. So it starts its own, named after the session. Two windows in a
      project therefore get one each and neither can take the other's down — they meet in the

      <h2 id="twice">Why balthasar needs it twice</h2>
      <p>A cleanup on the way out covers the exits that <i>have</i> a way out. A panic, an OOM and
      a <code>kill -9</code> run nothing at all inside magi, and those are exactly the exits that
      would strand a memory layer. So the kernel holds the second copy of the rule: magi names its
      own process id at spawn, and balthasar asks to be signalled when that process dies.</p>

      a week of work left a process per project.</p>

      <p>The registry replaces by name, so the order <i>is</i> the precedence: a file declaring

      <h2 id="told">What a tools program is told</h2>
      <p>Its settings come from the table named after the program itself, and ride on every spawn —
      there is no process alive between calls to send them to once.</p>
      <pre>magi.tools            = "workbench"
magi.workbench        = { quiet = true }   <span class="c">-- arrives as JSON in MAGI_TOOLS_CONFIGURE</span>
magi.workbench_sha256 = "…"               <span class="c">-- the bytes it must hash to, from magi doctor</span></pre>
      <p>For casper that is <code>magi.casper</code> and <code>magi.casper_sha256</code>, which is
      why a configuration written before roles existed still works: the default program’s table has
      the name it always had. The same value is also set as <code>CASPER_CONFIGURE</code>, which is
      what casper reads.</p>

      <h2 id="trust">Only your own configuration names one</h2>
      <p>A role’s program is started every turn with the session’s authority, which is more than a
      declared tool — and a project file is already refused a tool. So a <code>.magi.lua</code> that
      names a program for any role stops the session with a reason, rather than running what the
      checkout shipped beside itself. A project may still tune a sibling through its settings table;
      what is privileged is the name.</p>

      <h2 id="join">Writing one</h2>
      <p>Answer the family floor — <code>verbs</code> and <code>client</code>, in the reply shape —
      and the role’s core. Refuse the rest by name. There is no registration and no library to link:
      a library shared between these programs is the dependency the whole arrangement exists to
      prevent. The contract is <code>ROLES.md</code>, beside <code>FAMILY.md</code> in each of the
      four repositories.</p>

      <h2 id="where">Where the file goes</h2>
      <p>No entry point to edit, no manifest, no registration. Make the directory if it is not
      there:</p>
      <pre>~/.config/magi/plugin/yours.lua                        <span class="c">-- alphabetical, each on its own</span>

~/.config/magi/after/plugin/yours.lua                  <span class="c">-- the last word</span></pre>
      <p>The same three directories exist for <code>casper</code>, <code>melchior</code> and
      <code>balthasar</code>, holding their own registrars. Every registrar replaces by name, so
      the order <i>is</i> the precedence: <code>after/plugin/</code> is how you override something
      you did not write. Naming a file explicitly still works and is still the auditable case —
      <code>magi.load</code>, casper's <code>load</code> setting.</p>
${note("<b>A package you fetched does not run until you say so.</b> Files in your own <code>plugin/</code> directory are yours and run on sight; anything under <code>site/pack/</code> is held back until <code>magi acknowledge</code> records its digest, and held back again the moment it changes. Fetching is <code>git clone</code>; the idea is the lockfile.")}

      <h2 id="four">What a declaration owes</h2>

    if out == nil then return { content = err, is_error = true } end
    return { content = out }
  end,
})</pre>
${table(["field", "is"], [
  ["<code>description</code>", "what the model is told the tool does. This is the whole of how it decides to call it."],
  ["<code>parameters</code>", "JSON Schema for the arguments. The model is held to it before <code>run</code> is called."],
  ["<code>transport</code>", "how the body is reached. Not optional and no default — see below."],
  ["<code>needs</code>", "the permission verb this acts under. Omit it for a tool that touches nothing a person would want a say over."],
  ["<code>run</code>", "the body, for a <code>lua</code> transport. Returns <code>{ content = … }</code>, or <code>{ content = …, is_error = true }</code>."],
])}
      <p>There is no <code>os.execute</code> and no <code>io.popen</code> in the VM, and no
      <code>io</code> at all. <code>magi.shell</code> is the seam commands go through — the same
      ledger the shell tool passes, the same refusals — and <code>magi.fs.write</code> is the one
      for files. Both answer <code>nil, why</code> rather than raising.</p>

      <h2 id="transports">Four ways to be reached</h2>
${table(["transport", "is", "for"], [
  ["<code>lua</code>", "a body that runs in magi's own VM", "anything that is a few lines of logic"],
  ["<code>command</code>", "a program on <code>$PATH</code>, given the call as argv", "wrapping something that already exists"],
  ["<code>casper</code>", "<code>&lt;program&gt; run &lt;tool&gt;</code>, one exec per call", "whatever the tools role’s program offers — casper’s thirteen, unless <code>magi.tools</code> names another"],
  ["<code>builtin</code>", "compiled into magi", "the floor: <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>edit</code>"],
])}
      <p>The registry does not care which. One name, one entry, and the model sees the same
      declaration whichever way it is reached. A tool with a <code>run</code> and no transport is
      refused at load — the registry has no way to guess that the function is the point.</p>

      <h2 id="split">said and shown</h2>
      <p>A <b>casper</b> tool returns <code>said</code> and <code>shown</code> rather than
      <code>content</code>, and the split is the whole idea. <code>said</code> enters the
      transcript, is replayed on every subsequent request, and costs context every turn until the
      conversation is compacted. <code>shown</code> is drawn once and costs nothing.</p>
      <pre>casper.tool("patch", {
  description = "Show the difference between two files.",
  parameters  = { type = "object", properties = { old = { type = "string" } } },
  needs = "read",
  run = function(args)
    local done = casper.exec("diff", { "-u", args.old, args.new })
    return {
      said  = "3 files differ",                        <span class="c">-- the model reads this</span>
      shown = casper.paint.ansi(done.out, casper.theme), <span class="c">-- the person sees this</span>
    }
  end,
})</pre>
      <p>A tool that returns a hundred lines of diff as <code>said</code> has spent that budget for
      the rest of the session. The same diff as <code>shown</code>, with
      <code>said = "patched 3 files"</code>, costs four words. And a tool never names a colour: it
      says what its output <i>means</i> — <code>added</code>, <code>keyword</code>,
      <code>path</code> — and the harness resolves that against its own palette.</p>

      <h2 id="caps">Two caps you do not opt out of</h2>
      <ul class="plain">
        <li><b>Output is bounded.</b> Beyond the limit, the middle is dropped — head and tail both
        kept, because which one matters depends on the tool: a file read wants its head, a build
        that failed wants its tail. The whole of it is spilled to a file the note names.</li>
        <li><b>Secrets are masked by value.</b> The actual contents of this process's
        credential variables are replaced by their names before anything enters a transcript. Not
        by pattern — by value, so a key that does not look like a key is caught too.</li>
      </ul>
${note("<b>Here rather than in the tools</b>, because a peer is another program and cannot be trusted to cap itself, a Lua tool has no way to write a spill file, and a shipped declaration has no knob to set. Every result of every transport passes through one place, which is the only place that is true of.")}

      <h2 id="watch">Watching a session</h2>
      <p>The other registrar. A watcher is told after the fact and answers with nothing: it cannot
      change a result and cannot fail one, so observing a session is not a way to break it.</p>
      <pre>magi.watch("timing", {
  run = function(event)
    if event.kind ~= "turn.ended" then return end
    magi.fs.write(os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.local/state/magi/last", event.took_ms .. "ms\\n")
  end,
})</pre>
      <p>Branch on <code>event.kind</code> and nothing else. There are eight:
      <code>session.opened</code>, <code>turn.began</code>, <code>turn.ended</code>,
      <code>tool.finished</code>, <code>permission.asked</code>,
      <code>permission.answered</code>, <code>context.compacted</code> and
      <code>provider.retried</code>.</p>

      <h2 id="asking">A tool that asks a question</h2>
      <p>A declaration reads <code>args.answered</code> to know it is resuming. The answer travels
      <i>with</i> the arguments rather than beside them — merged, so a declaration writes
      <code>args.answered</code> and not <code>args.call.answered</code>. The answer is one more
      thing known about this call, which is what an argument is.</p>

      <h2 id="stable">What is stable</h2>
      <p><code>magi verbs</code> reports <code>surface</code>, which versions everything on this
      page. It is <b>1</b>. Adding a registrar, a field or an event does not move it — a file
      written against 1 keeps running. Renaming one, removing one, or changing what a field means
      does.</p>

      <p>A rule written down is not a question asked. The standing answers are ones you decided in

      grants nothing.</b></p>

      <h2 id="confine">Confinement is a wall</h2>
      <p><code>magi.confine</code> refuses paths outside the session root outright — no prompt, no

      sits before the ledger rather than inside it.</p>
${note("<b>It is not containment.</b> Confinement covers <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> and <code>edit</code>. It moved work to the shell, which has none — <code>bwrap</code> in front of the shell peer is what actually contains anything.")}

      <h2 id="nobody">When nobody is there</h2>
      <p>A run with no UI attached has nobody to ask. It is refused, and the tool is told why — a
      session whose front end has detached does not get to assume the answer would have been yes.
      That is why <code>magi -p</code> refuses an ungranted read rather than hanging on a question
      nobody can see.</p>

      <h2 id="out">Out: nothing waits on it</h2>
      <p>A session is behind a mutex and a commit is a short lock. Putting a socket round trip
      inside one would make every entry wait on another process, so what is committed is
      <i>queued</i> and the turn carries on. If the write never lands, the entry is still in the
      window — only the durable record is lost.</p>

      <h2 id="in">In: nothing is trusted blindly</h2>
      <p>Recall returns memories with a confidence. Anything below the floor is dropped rather
      than hedged, and what survives is written into the window as <b>one user message that says
      what it is</b> — never slipped in as though the conversation had contained it.</p>

      <h2 id="back">Back: did it help</h2>
      <p>A turn reports what it used and how that went. balthasar decides for itself whether the
      action followed from anything it gave; a harness claiming a match it did not verify would be
      asserting an analysis rather than reporting an event.</p>

      <h2 id="scope">Which store a directory gets</h2>
${plate("d-scope", "plate 07", "walk up until something claims it")}
      <p>A store somebody made deliberately wins first; then the checkout the directory is in.
      Five worktrees of one project share one memory rather than starting each other's amnesia.</p>
${note("<b>Both walks stop before a directory nobody owns.</b> Without a ceiling, one stray marker high up collects everything beneath it — and both kinds occur naturally: a leftover store in the temporary directory, and a <code>.git</code> at <code>$HOME</code>, which is what an ordinary dotfiles repository is. Either would put unrelated projects into a single memory. The rule is stricter for the <i>inferred</i> marker than the deliberate one: a repository at <code>$HOME</code> is not the project a subdirectory belongs to, while a store somebody explicitly created there is.")}

      <h2 id="resume">Resuming</h2>
      <p>With balthasar running there is <b>no journal on disk at all</b> — it is the store, and a
      second copy is a copy that goes stale. <code>magi --resume</code> asks balthasar which runs
      this project has had and replays the newest.</p>
      <pre>$ magi -p "remember the number 8231, just say ok"
ok
$ magi --resume -p "what number did I ask you to remember?"
8231</pre>
      <p>A separate process, after the first one and the balthasar it started are both gone. What
      survives is the store, not a running thing.</p>
      <p>The program holding it is whatever fills the <code>memory</code> role — balthasar unless
      <code>magi.memory</code> names another. <code>--resume</code> needs only the role’s core:
      <code>sessions</code> to find the newest run, <code>replay</code> to read it back. Both wait
      for a store that is still opening, rather than resuming into an empty conversation.</p>

      <p>Sessions in different projects never can, at any setting. This only widens things inside

      <h2 id="fork">A child of this session</h2>
      <pre>magi fork "review the parser" --role reviewer --role-description "reads diffs, writes none"</pre>
      <p>melchior names the child and mints the secret that makes it stoppable; magi starts the
      process. The child is told which session started it and leaves when that one does. It gets no
      more than its parent has — a child that wants something outside that is refused and told to
      ask its parent. A role given at birth is a label others can route by, and it grants
      nothing.</p>

      <h2 id="crew">The crew</h2>
      <p>A model reaches the other agents through one tool, whose verbs melchior answers on its
      <code>tool</code> door:</p>
${table(["verbs", "for"], [
  ["<code>list</code> <code>whoami</code> <code>about</code> <code>crew</code>", "who is here, who started whom, and what each is for"],
  ["<code>send</code> <code>ask</code> <code>reply</code> <code>inbox</code>", "talking — an answer can arrive long after the connection that carried the question has closed"],
  ["<code>claim</code> <code>claims</code> <code>release</code>", "saying what one is working on, so two agents do not both do it"],
  ["<code>assign</code> <code>task</code> <code>handoff</code>", "handing work to another agent, and keeping a handle on it"],
  ["<code>stop</code> <code>disband</code>", "ending a child, or a whole branch of them"],
])}
      <p>Every session publishes its screen beside its socket, so the one terminal you have moves
      from agent to agent rather than a window being opened per agent.</p>

      <h2 id="verbs">What a session may say</h2>
      <p>The vocabulary has <b>no verb that runs anything</b>. It sends messages, reads an inbox,
      and says who is listening — deliberately, and melchior's own tests refuse a verb named
      <code>run</code>, <code>shell</code>, <code>exec</code> or <code>eval</code>.</p>
      <p>That is why magi grants the agent tool in advance rather than asking. Granting it grants
      the ability to talk to other sessions, which is the whole of what the tool is for — and
      asking here cannot work anyway: the prompt would land mid-conversation, stopping the turn a
      sibling's question started on a keystroke nobody was told about.</p>

      <h2 id="dead">A socket nobody answers</h2>
      <p>A process that died did not get to remove itself from a list, so a stale socket looks
      exactly like a live one until something connects. Liveness is <b>asked, never assumed</b>:
      one cheap call settles it. Dialling is not liveness either — the kernel accepts on behalf of
      a listener whose owner has stopped reading, so a wedged sibling accepts instantly and then
      never answers.</p>

      <p>deepseek's 39-fold shrink measures <b>scope abandoned</b>, not modularity won — its own
      README says as much: <i>“This is not a Cordis port.”</i> pi's is the interesting one, because
      nothing was abandoned. The packages simply stopped existing.</p>

      <h2 id="why">Why pi's boundary evaporated</h2>
      <p>pi-ts's package boundary was not held by discipline or by review. It was held by <b>the npm
      resolver</b>, which sits on the critical path of every build, plus a script that parsed every
      build program with the compiler's own API — at pre-commit <i>and</i> in CI.</p>
      <p>Rust has exactly one construct with that resolver property, and it is the crate.
      <b>Inside a crate there is no resolver at all.</b> So the rewrite did not weaken the
      eleven-package graph; it deleted it. Violating any conceptual boundary in pi today costs
      seven keystrokes and nothing fails.</p>
      <p>The measurement: under nerv's own hygiene rules, pi now holds a mutually recursive core of
      <b>23 modules</b> on the strict reading and 57 on the broad one.</p>
${note("<b>And pi is not a project that skipped its gates.</b> Its module-reachability check runs in CI and passes cleanly at 240,000 lines: 144 declared, 141 reachable, 0 unreachable. It built the <b>reachability</b> gate and never built the <b>direction</b> gate — and a 57-module cycle is maximally reachable. nerv's own <code>gate-reachable</code> has exactly the same blind spot, which is why <code>gate-cycles</code> was written.")}

      <h2 id="invariant">The invariant</h2>
      <p><b>Only the boundaries that were already data survived.</b> The npm package graph, the
      entry-file budgets, the dependency-injection container, the import-closure verifier — deleted,
      stubbed, or rebuilt at a fraction of their expressiveness. What translated intact was
      <i>declared dependencies between compilation units</i>, because Cargo implements it, and a
      YAML patch file, because it is a file.</p>
      <p>Which puts a sharp question to nerv: what here is data?</p>
${table(["", "would survive a rewrite"], [
  ["the Lua layer — 9,034 lines across four programs", "<b>yes.</b> Tool declarations, provider catalogs, wire protocols and client stubs are files, not code."],
  ["the socket and pipe protocols", "<b>yes.</b> A shape on a wire is a shape on a wire."],
  ["the crate graph inside each program", "only if the next language has a resolver at that granularity"],
  ["the module structure inside a crate", "<b>no.</b> This is exactly what pi lost."],
])}
      <p>The Lua layer is the closest thing in any of the six trees to the one deepseek-ts mechanism
      that came through its rewrite intact. That is an argument for putting more in it, not less.</p>

      <h2 id="unit">The unit you pick is permanent</h2>
      <p>pi chose <code>pub mod</code> in its first commit. Five thousand commits later there is no
      path back — nothing in the tree even discusses the alternative. A crate costs twenty lines of
      manifest.</p>
      <p>nerv's own tree shows the same force at work: <b>the two programs with production module
      cycles are exactly the two with no gates</b>. That is not a coincidence about those two
      programs; it is what happens wherever nothing refuses.</p>

      <p>pi-ts's is the discipline worth envying: because every rule runs at commit time and not
      only in CI, its 21-edge graph has <b>zero cycles</b>, no relative import escaping a package,
      and declared dependencies matching actual imports exactly. nerv's declared graph was ten
      per cent fiction at the time of measurement — six declared-but-never-imported edges of
      fifty-nine.</p>

      <h2 id="below">Nothing constrains anything below the crate</h2>
      <p>This is the honest gap. Cargo enforces the crate edge and enforces nothing inside it, so a
      single crate can grow any shape it likes. pi-ts constrains boundary <i>depth</i> on a walked
      graph with a stated cost model, and can mark a subtree as excluded-from-build-but-imported —
      making it a boundary rather than a comment. nerv has no equivalent.</p>
      <p>What nerv legislates instead is <b>one ceiling: files</b>, at 800 lines, and it holds
      across every file in every repository. But deepseek-ts keeps 97% of its files under 800 with
      <b>no file-size gate at all</b> — so the rule buys the absence of a long tail rather than a
      better median. And the <i>unit</i> is unruled: two crates are half of magi.</p>
${note("<b>A number that was reported wrongly the first time.</b> Build ceremony was quoted as 31.7% against 0.8% until it was checked — three-quarters of that gap was READMEs and translations, which scores nerv's <i>absence of documentation</i> as a win. Like for like it is 20 lines per crate against 57 per npm package. A comparison that faults undocumented seams elsewhere cannot also bank their absence as a saving.")}

      <p>deepseek documents a plugin seam and ships the “unavailable” answer for it. That is
      honest, and it is the whole story. pi is thirteen times our size and is the only one of the
      three that has actually been extended by strangers — which is the fact worth taking
      seriously, and the reason for everything below.</p>

      <h2 id="reach">What a third party can reach</h2>
${table(["", "and how"], [
  ["a tool", "<code>magi.tool</code>, or <code>casper.tool</code> for one that runs a program"],
  ["a watcher", "<code>magi.watch</code> — eight events, told after the fact, answering nothing"],
  ["a wire protocol", "<code>melchior.api</code>. The registry is readable, so a dialect that differs from a shipped one in one function borrows the other three"],
  ["a provider", "<code>melchior.provider</code> — an endpoint, a credential, and either a model list or <code>discover = true</code>"],
  ["a memory source", "<code>balthasar.source</code>. No Rust file in balthasar names a harness; a new one is a file, not a release"],
  ["what a model is told", "<code>balthasar.section</code> — weight, order, filter, and a confidence floor"],
])}

      <h2 id="where">Where it goes</h2>
      <p>neovim's runtimepath, unchanged, in all four. Twenty years of real plugins have been
      written against it and most people arriving already know it; deviating buys nothing and
      costs everyone the transfer.</p>
      <pre>~/.config/&lt;program&gt;/plugin/*.lua                        <span class="c">alphabetical, each on its own</span>
~/.local/share/&lt;program&gt;/site/pack/*/start/*/plugin/*.lua  <span class="c">installed packages</span>
~/.config/&lt;program&gt;/after/plugin/*.lua                  <span class="c">the last word</span></pre>
      <p>Every registrar replaces by name, so the order <i>is</i> the precedence. No manifest, no
      registration, no entry point to edit — requiring an edit to your own <code>init.lua</code> to
      enable somebody's package makes every package a merge conflict with your configuration.</p>

      <h2 id="contain">What contains it</h2>
      <p>pi gives its extensions a default grant of read, write, http, events and session, and
      never asks. It has a capability policy because it embedded a language that can do anything;
      the policy exists to take that back.</p>
      <p>nerv never handed it over. The sandbox is a removal list — <code>os.execute</code>,
      <code>io.popen</code>, <code>io</code> entirely, <code>require</code>, <code>dofile</code>,
      <code>loadfile</code> — applied to the VM before any file runs. What is left cannot spawn or
      touch a file. Running a command goes through the same ledger the shell tool passes; writing
      one goes through the same gate the write tool passes. <b>A discovered file is held to exactly
      what a named one is.</b></p>
${note("<b>The inversion that made this urgent is closed.</b> For a while the one program loading third-party packages was the one VM still keeping <code>os.execute</code>. The removal list applies in all four now, and discovery arrived after it rather than before.")}

      <h2 id="trust">What a package costs to trust</h2>
      <p>pi's package manager is 8,579 lines: npm and git sources, user and project scopes, a
      lockfile with digests and trust states. Most of that is a package ecosystem nobody here
      wants to be in. The ten per cent worth having is the part about <i>trust</i> rather than
      fetching, and it is what pi conspicuously does for MCP servers and not for its own
      extensions.</p>
${table(["", ""], [
  ["a file you wrote", "runs on sight. A prompt about your own configuration is one nobody reads — it trains people to say yes."],
  ["a package you fetched", "held back until <code>&lt;program&gt; acknowledge</code> records its SHA-256, and held back again the moment it changes"],
])}
      <p>Fetching is <code>git clone</code>. The lockfile is the idea. A manifest that will not
      parse reads as empty, which holds everything back rather than letting everything through.</p>

      <h2 id="stable">What is promised</h2>
      <p><code>&lt;program&gt; verbs</code> reports <code>surface</code>, separate from
      <code>family</code>: one versions the wire between these programs, the other versions what an
      extension is written against. Both move only when something already published stops working.</p>
      <p>Five registrars were published, dead and unversioned for most of this project's life. A
      number an extension can read is what closes that window deliberately rather than by
      accident — and the examples in every repository are run by that repository's own test suite,
      because an example that does not load is worse than no example.</p>
${note("<b>Still ahead of us.</b> pi's ~78 example extensions are not documentation; they are how it knows the surface works, and ours has been used by nobody who did not write it. That is the measurement this section cannot yet make.")}

    "permission layer at all. nerv bet on the question a tool is made to ask. Measured against " +
    "the Rust ports, which is where these layers are comparable at all.",
  body: `
      <h2 id="shape">The shape of each</h2>
${table(["", "pi", "deepseek", "nerv"], [
  ["permission model", "3 global modes, allow or deny, not persisted", "<b>none</b>", "4 verbs × 5 widths, with a session ledger"],
  ["dangerous-command analysis", "a shell-out, or ten in-tree danger classes", "none", "<b>none</b>"],

  ["tool declaration", "one implementation <b>per tool</b> — 38 of them", "one per tool", "one <b>per transport</b> — five"],
])}

      <h2 id="transport">One implementation per transport</h2>
      <p>That last row is nerv's one genuinely better idea, and it is architectural rather than
      stylistic: <b>adding a way to reach a tool cannot add a way to run one.</b> Every
      cross-cutting concern lives at a single funnel, and there is exactly one place to put it —
      the output cap, the schema check, the argument repair, the secrets mask.</p>
      <p>pi's equivalent of the output cap is seven hundred lines of spill machinery <i>inside</i>
      its tool file, with its own redaction engine, because pi's tools each produce output
      independently. deepseek has no cap at all.</p>

      <h2 id="injection">The claim, and its limit</h2>
      <p>nerv's <code>command</code> transport runs a program with an <b>argument vector</b> built
      from the call. No shell, so a value containing <code>;</code> or <code>$(…)</code> is one
      argument, verbatim. It is the only one of the three where the default way to declare a new
      tool cannot be command-injected.</p>
      <p><b>That is a claim about the transport, not about the shipped tools.</b> The shell tool
      nerv actually ships is a Lua declaration that interpolates the model's string into a
      compound <code>sh -c</code>. It is a shell string end to end, exactly like pi's and
      deepseek's. Both facts belong in the ledger.</p>

      <h2 id="widths">Why five widths</h2>
      <p>One request can be answered at several widths, because how much you want to grant depends
      on what was asked. Saying yes to <i>this exact command, once</i> and yes to <i>anything under
      this directory, forever</i> are both reasonable answers to the same prompt — and a system
      offering only one of them will be answered carelessly.</p>
      <p>pi has three global modes and no persistence, so “allow always” is not expressible; the
      pressure that creates is toward the mode that stops asking. deepseek asks nothing.
      <a href="../guides/permissions.html">The widths are set out here.</a></p>

      <h2 id="found">What auditing this found</h2>
      <p>The design being the best of the three did not stop the implementation being weaker than
      it reads. Three holes were verified by running them, not by reading:</p>
      <ul class="plain">
        <li><b>A directory grant compared unnormalised paths</b>, so a grant on <code>work</code>
        covered <code>work/sub/../../secret</code>. Fixed: paths are normalised before the action
        is built.</li>
        <li><b>Confinement was silently dropped whenever anybody was watching.</b> It applied only
        to headless sessions — the exact case where nobody is there to catch anything. Fixed.</li>
        <li><b>A grant on <code>git</code> covered <code>git status; rm -rf /</code></b>, because
        the program was the first word and the command line sat in the rest. Fixed: a command
        carrying a shell metacharacter is covered by no program grant, so it is asked about
        instead.</li>
      </ul>
${note("<b>That last one was published on this site as already true before it was.</b> It was written from the design and never checked against the code. It is true now — a grant that answers “any <code>git</code> command” stops at the first <code>;</code> — and the way it was found is the argument for the whole exercise: pi's equivalent check is about fifteen lines and six tests, and reading it is what exposed the gap.")}

      <h2 id="still">Still open</h2>
      <ul class="plain">
        <li><b>Nothing analyses a command before running it.</b> nerv decides whether an action is
        permitted, not whether it is wise. pi has ten danger classes.</li>
        <li><b>A grant on <code>sh</code> is an unbounded shell by construction</b>, not by
        bypass — which is what the person asked for, and worth knowing they asked it.</li>
        <li><b>Automatic approvals are not audited.</b> A ledger hit returns quietly, so “what did
        this session do under standing grants” has no answer. pi audits every decision, including
        the ones nobody saw.</li>
        <li><b>File opens are not hardened against the race.</b> Lexical normalise, then read. pi
        canonicalises, opens with <code>O_NOFOLLOW</code>, re-stats the descriptor and refuses if
        it moved.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="same">The same shape, at a tenth of the cost</h2>
      <p>pi and nerv arrive at structurally similar layers — a catalog of vendors as data, a small
      set of protocol adapters, one neutral message model. pi pays roughly ten times for it, and
      <b>most of that is not the process boundary</b>. It is the difference between “a protocol is
      a Rust module” and “a protocol is a Lua table”.</p>
      <pre><span class="c">-- melchior/config/providers.lua — one provider, no rebuild</span>

  models = { { id = "deepseek-chat" } },
})</pre>

      <h2 id="best">The best idea in pi's provider layer</h2>
      <p>Its table feeds everything else, including predicates that would otherwise be hardcoded
      lists — “is this provider keyless” is <i>derived</i> from having no auth variables and no
      auth header, so local runtimes work without being named anywhere — and including the
      published documentation, rendered from the same table with a golden test on the output.
      That is cheap and worth having.</p>

      <h2 id="ours">What the separate process is for</h2>
      <ul class="plain">
        <li><b>One parser for every provider's stream</b>, on a correct argument, rather than four.</li>
        <li><b>A typed failure class that reaches the loop and changes what the loop does</b> —
        rather than a regular expression over the vendor's prose.</li>
        <li><b>Retry and retraction as one end-to-end contract</b>: the screen is told to un-draw
        what a failed attempt already streamed. Neither of the others has this.</li>
        <li><b>Three protocol hostings sharing one body</b>, differing in about ten lines. pi's
        equivalent for one vendor is 1,882.</li>
      </ul>
${note("<b>What was deliberately not taken:</b> the 103-row table itself, the hand-rolled HTTP client, the failover chains, the credential-rotation ring, and the credential scavenging that reads other agents' configuration files. Seven providers answer the same question, and the eighth costs ten lines.")}
